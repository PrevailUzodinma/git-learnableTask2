### Version control like ABC
Imagine you want to draw a man, you start with a blank sheet of paper and each them you make a change to the drawing, you decide to take a snapshot like for the head region, the upper body region, the lowerbody region. The snapshot is like a picture of the drawing at that moment of change, that is what **Version Control** is like.

**Version Control** is a system that helps you manage changes to a project's code or files over time by helping you keep track of different versions of your project, collaborate with others and easily revert to previous states. One example of **Version Control** is **Git**.

### Difference between Git and GitHub
| S/N | Git | GitHub |
| -- | ------- | ------|
| 1.| Git is a version control system that tracks changes in a source code. | GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and managing repositories.
| 2. | Git can be used independently on a local machine. | GitHub is a remote service that facilitates collaboration and project management on the web.

### Other **GitHub** alternatives
Other repo-hosting platforms asides **GitHub** include
1. GitLab
2. BitBucket
3. Gitea

### Difference between git fetch and git pull
| S/N | git fetch | git pull |
| -- | ------ | ------ |
| 1. | It retrieves changes from the remote repository but does not automatically merge them to the local working branch | It automatically retrieves changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local working branch.|
| 2. | It fetches only, you will have to merge the changes separately to effect changes | It is a combination of fetching and merging |

### git rebase
**git rebase** is a command used in Git to modify the commit history of a branch. Unlike *git merge*, which combines the changes from one branch into another, **git rebase** integrates the changes by moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. This results in a linear and cleaner commit history. It is like reorganizing the commits of a branch.
The commsnd for it is **"git rebase"**.
