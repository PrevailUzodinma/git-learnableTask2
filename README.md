### Version control like ABC
Imagine you want to draw a man, you start with a blank sheet of paper and each them you make a change to the drawing, you decide to take a snapshot like for the head region, the upper body region, the lowerbody region. The snapshot is like a picture of the drawing at that moment of change, that is what **Version Control** is like.

**Version Control** is a system that helps you manage changes to a project's code or files over time by helping you keep track of different versions of your project, collaborate with others and easily revert to previous states. One example of **Version Control** is **Git**.
